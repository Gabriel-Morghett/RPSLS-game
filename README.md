# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This game is an extension of the old, well known game "Rock paper scissors", or Jankenpon, from Japanese

## How the game works
In this variant, two more options are added to the game, Lizard and Spock, with a total of 5 options for the players to choose from. Even with this addition, every option still interects with eachother in a fair way, meaning each option will win agains 2 options, loose against the other 2 and tie when matched with itself.

The exact way these interactions occur are listed here:
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes rock
- Rock crushes scissors
